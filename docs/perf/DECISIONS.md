**Purpose**: Log all decisions that could affect search behavior, ranking, or correctness.

## Decision Log

### 2026-10-12: Initial Planning
**Context**: Beginning performance optimization project for public deployment.

**Decision**: Adopt phased approach with measurement-first strategy.

**Rationale**: 
- Avoids premature optimization
- Establishes baselines to measure improvement
- Ensures correctness preserved throughout

**Impact**: None yet (planning phase)

---

### 2026-10-12: Phase 1 Instrumentation
**Context**: Need to identify actual bottlenecks before optimizing.

**Decision**: Add comprehensive measurement infrastructure with minimal behavior changes:
- Golden query set (40 queries) with full result snapshot
- Cold vs warm timing (10 runs per query)
- DB query counter via SQLAlchemy event listener
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE profiling script
- Comparison tool to detect ranking changes

**Implementation**:
- Created `scripts/benchmark.py` for automated performance measurement
- Created `scripts/compare_golden.py` for correctness verification
- Created `scripts/golden_queries.json` with 5 categories × 8 queries
- Created `scripts/explain_queries.py` for database query plan analysis (fixed vector syntax)
- Added `backend/app/core/query_counter.py` for DB query tracking
- Modified `backend/app/api/v1/search.py` to expose query count in benchmark mode

**Translator Caching**: 
- Benchmark script pre-warms client-side translator cache
- Server-side translator calls in engine.py (lines ~496-502) are NOT frozen/cached
- For fully deterministic runs, dynamic translation should be disabled during benchmarking

**Benchmark Execution**:
- Background task timed out after 10 minutes
- User must run benchmark locally in their terminal
- `PERF_BENCHMARK=1` must be set in the SERVER terminal (not client script)
- Use `poetry run python scripts/benchmark.py` from project root

**Impact**:
- Performance: None (measurement only, no optimization yet)
- Correctness: Unchanged (instrumentation behind PERF_BENCHMARK flag)
- Trade-offs: None

**Verification**: All changes are read-only instrumentation or behind environment flag

### 2026-10-12: Baseline Corrections

**Context**: Initial BASELINE.md analysis contained several errors based on misreading the JSON data.

**Corrections Made**:

1. **DB query instrumentation**: PERF_BENCHMARK *was* properly set. DB query counts are populated for all queries that reach the database (kalayaan=44, simbahan=38, bayan=42, education=42). The zeros appear only on korapsyon and out-of-domain queries, which return early with reason "unmapped_standalone_concept" before touching the DB. Stage-level timing (preprocessing, model encoding, theme expansion, etc.) was NOT instrumented.

2. **Server crash claim**: Unsupported. baseline_timings.json has 10 runs for all 40 queries, including "online", and golden_snapshot.json has all 40 queries. Removed crash note from documentation.

3. **Theme classification / N+1 hypothesis**: REFUTED by the data. DB query counts are nearly identical (38-44) across fast and slow queries, yet latency differs 4-12x:
   - bayan: 42 queries, 2.5s
   - kalayaan: 44 queries, 12.3s
   - edukasyon: 44 queries, 32.1s
   
   If N+1 context expansion was the culprit, identical query counts would produce similar latency. The extra time is NOT from DB round-trips.

4. **Numeric corrections**:
   - edukasyon cold: 38.9s (not 32.5s)
   - kamatayan cold: 11.3s (not 17.1s)
   - first request: 25.00s (not 25.98s)
   - memory delta: -11.79 MB (not 0.05 MB) - client-side measurement, not meaningful
   
   Regenerated category tables directly from JSON with analyze_baseline.py script.

5. **EXPLAIN queries**: ALL EXPLAIN queries failed. The embedding was stringified character-by-character ('[', '0', '.', ...), not as a proper array literal. Previous "fixed vector syntax" claims in STATE.md and DECISIONS.md were incorrect. explain_queries.py needs proper array literal formatting.

**New Observations (Data-Driven)**:

- **2.4s floor**: Every query has a baseline cost of ~2.4s, even korapsyon (4 DB queries) and out-of-domain queries (0 DB queries, 0 results). This floor is NOT from DB work or result processing.

- **Semantic fallback correlation**: Slow queries (kalayaan, pag-ibig, edukasyon) are all result_mode="semantic_fallback". Fast queries (bayan, simbahan) are "lexical". BUT English fallback queries (oppression, love, justice) are FAST (~2.4-2.7s), so "fallback" itself is not the trigger. Candidate: theme expansion or candidate pool size for specific Tagalog terms.

- **Out-of-domain is slow**: Out-of-domain rejection (0 DB queries) takes 3.4s average - SLOWER than valid lexical queries (2.5s). The early-reject path is not cheap. Likely costs: query preprocessing, model encoding, theme expansion, or translator network calls.

- **No caching**: Warm == cold across all queries. No query result caching, no model output caching, no meaningful warm-up effect.

**Revised Hypotheses**:

1. Theme expansion for specific Tagalog terms (likely: massive keyword generation or expensive matrix operations)
2. Semantic candidate pool processing (large retrieval sets for certain queries)
3. Model encoding (contributes to 2.4s floor)
4. Translator network calls (contributes to floor for cross-lingual queries)
5. ~~Theme classification / N+1 context expansion~~ → **REFUTED**

**Decision**: Proceed with Phase 1b instrumentation (stage-level timing) before any optimization.

**Impact**: No code changes yet. Documentation corrections only.

## Ranking Change Policy

Any change that affects search result order MUST:
1. Be explicitly approved by user
2. Be logged here with full justification
3. Include before/after comparison on golden query set
4. Document the specific ranking delta (# of position changes)
5. Explain why the change improves search quality

**Current ranking changes**: None
